# DSCI-644: Group 10 - Comparative Study of Text Classification Algorithms 

## 1. Overview:

This project aims to compare the performance of different text classification machine learning models by implementing different text classification algorithms on a different datasets.

## 2. Source Files

The `News_Dataset_Topic_Classification_Models_&_NN.ipynb` is the main source file. It performs various text classification algorithms (Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, ...) on the news-10-groups dataset and compare performances using Accuracy, Precions, Recall as metrics. Over, Logisic Regression and Random Forest yields the best results. All models suffer from class imbalance and high false positive rates. Neural Network models take the longest time to produce results. 

## 3. How to run this project
User can simply load the notebook the `News_Dataset_Topic_Classification_Models_&_NN.ipynb` file either locally or via Google Colab and hit "play" button.
